/**
 * General IO stream manipulation utilities.
 *
 *
 * This class provides static utility methods for input/output operations.
 *
 *  * closeQuietly - these methods close a stream ignoring nulls and exceptions
 *  * toXxx/read - these methods read data from a stream
 *  * write - these methods write data to a stream
 *  * copy - these methods copy all the data from one stream to another
 *  * contentEquals - these methods compare the content of two streams
 *
 *
 *
 * The byte-to-char methods and char-to-byte methods involve a conversion step.
 * Two methods are provided in each case, one that uses the platform default
 * encoding and the other which allows you to specify an encoding. You are
 * encouraged to always specify an encoding because relying on the platform
 * default can lead to unexpected results, for example when moving from
 * development to production.
 *
 *
 * All the methods in this class that read a stream are buffered internally.
 * This means that there is no cause to use a `BufferedInputStream`
 * or `BufferedReader`. The default buffer size of 4K has been shown
 * to be efficient in tests.
 *
 *
 * Wherever possible, the methods in this class do *not* flush or close
 * the stream. This is to avoid making non-portable assumptions about the
 * streams' origin and further use. Thus the caller is still responsible for
 * closing streams after use.
 *
 *
 * Origin of code: Excalibur.
